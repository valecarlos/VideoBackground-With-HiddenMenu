# VideoBackground-With-HiddenMenu
The idea of this project is to create a single landing page with a video background with an additional menu that can be hidden with CSS only

The first step of the project consisted on getting a full screen background video for the website, that is responsive to browser resizing.
Additionally Bootstrap was used to create a search form in the centre of the viewport and to create an icon to hide/show a sidebar menu.

Hiding/Showing the sidebar menu works purely with CSS selectors, JS was intentionally not used during the development.

How does it work?

The video was downloaded from https://videos.pexels.com/ which doesn't require mentioning for using their videos, but it's a cool website that might come handy.
